Learning Objectives:
  1. Pseudocode & Flowcharts
  2. Simple Java syntax
  
Overview:
  Software development is, in essence, problem solving. The course will help apply computer programming to real-world problems. This module will teach basics of programming in Java. Best practices and proper organizational techniques will also be taught. Emphasized again is the need for psuedocode and flowcharts.

Two mottoes in software development are vital:
  Save early, safe often.
  Test early, test often.
  
Adopting the above two mottoes will save a lot of debugging time in the long run. Essentially, don't wait to have an entirely built program to save and test your code.

The IDE they recommend using is the Eclipse IDE, it also mentions using a virtual lab to use the Eclipse IDE, but hopefully that's not mandatory. There is also a book requirement, specifically for an access code to zyBooks.
